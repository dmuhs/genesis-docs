### Do you support my system?

We are completely system agnostic, we only require a containerized application architecture.
If you can deploy your system on Kubernetes or Docker Compose, then you can use Genesis! If you aren't already containerized, it is easy to get setup for most modern applications. You can find more information [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

### Do you store my cloud or docker credentials

We do not store any of your credentials in a database. They passed along on our secure internal system bus to the different services that need it for the test, and disappear after the test has finished.
